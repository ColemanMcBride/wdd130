            I am an Automotive Engineering Technology major at Brigham Young
            University- Idaho, currently in my Sophomore year. I grew up in
            Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, where I had five siblings and two
            wonderful parents. My fiance, Shay, and I will be married later this
            summer.

            My love for cars began on a family vacation, where my cousins and I
            would guess the car brand of an approaching vehicle. Ever since
            then, I've enjoyed spotting and identifying cars on the road and
            researching the newest models as they are released. I've also
            attended a number of motor shows, including the Harrisburg Auto
            Show, Corvettes at Carlisle, and Chrysler Nationals. I'm a proud
            owner of a 2010 Volvo XC70, and my dream car is a Lotus Evora 400.
