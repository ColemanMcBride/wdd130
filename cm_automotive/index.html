        I am an Automotive Engineering Technology major at Brigham Young
        University- Idaho, currently in my Sophomore year. I grew up in
        Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, where I had five siblings and two wonderful
        parents. My fiance, Shay, and I will be married later this summer.

        My love for cars began on a family vacation, where my cousins and I
        would guess the car brand of an approaching vehicle. Ever since then,
        I've enjoyed spotting and identifying cars on the road and researching
        the newest models as they are released. I've also attended a number of
        motor shows, including the Harrisburg Auto Show, Corvettes at Carlisle,
        and Chrysler Nationals. I'm a proud owner of a 2010 Volvo XC70, and my
        dream car is a Lotus Evora 400.
