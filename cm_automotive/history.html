        <h4>1886</h4>
        <p>
          The automobile has been around in some form since 1886, when German
          inventor Karl Benz created the Benz Patent-Motorwagen.

        <p>
          For over a decade, automobiles were seen as a toy for the rich, until
          Ford Motor Company, led by Henry Ford, created the Ford Model T in
          1908. This vehicle revolutionized the car market, allowing automobile
          ownership to be available to the general populus instead of only the
          rich.

        <h4>1942</h4>
        <p>
          Cars continued to shift and change in shape and form until the WWII,
          when many automotive manufacturers shifted their resources towards the
          war effort. Their massive factories were used to manufacture tanks,
          weapons, planes, and other war-related vehicles.

        <p>
          While the war put a pause on the car market, many important
          developments came about as a result. Infrastructure expansion, coupled
          with improved engine, safety, and comfort technologies, increased
          popularity of the automobile in the US.

      <div id="seventies">
        <h4>1973</h4>
        <p>
          Gas crises in the 1970s led to further developments in the auto
          industry, shifting the focus from large gas-guzzling vehicles to
          smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Interest in hybrid, electric,
          and other alternative fuel types increased, and emissions regulations
          became more strict.

        <img src="images/prius.jpg" alt="2001 Toyota Prius" />
        <p>
          In the late 1990s and early 2000s, hybrid vehicles began to become
          more mainstream, through the introduction of models such as the Toyota
          Prius and Honda Insight.

        <h4>2012</h4>
        <p>
          Tesla Motors began selling the Model S in 2012, marking one of the
          first mainstream fully-electric vehicles. These hybrid and electric
          technologies have become staples of the modern car market, and many
          major manufacturers have plans to "electrify" their entire line of
          vehicles in the coming years.
