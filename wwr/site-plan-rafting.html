      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to build revenue by attracting potential
        customers, relaying important information about pricing and creating an

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Our main audience is parents of families with teen/young adult aged
        children, meaning we will focus our content will be on family fun and
        long-lasting memories. These parents are likely trying to expose their
        children to positive experiences and bond as a family. I imagine that
        our customers will approach our website from many different platforms
        (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices), so trying to make a website
        that is simple and flexible would likely be optimal.
